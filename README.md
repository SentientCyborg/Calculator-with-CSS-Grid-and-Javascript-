# Calculator-with-CSS-Grid-and-Javascript-
A simple calculator with a CSS Grid layout and a Javascript backend. 

I made this calculator to practice JavaScript. It currently has a few bugs, but I uploaded it anyways so I can practice using git. 

Some of the bugs I've found so far are as follows:

  - Dividing by zero results in an answer of zero, but it should be "undefined".
  - There is no functionality for negative numbers--they just display as positive numbers.
  - Not really a bug, but there are no commas to seperate out large digits.

I based the calculator design off of others I've seen online. I liked the idea of being able to see the original inputs on the screen, 
but I think having two display areas created unnecessary complexity relative to my skill level. I didn't use any classes in this project, because I haven't learned
how to implement them in JavaScript yet.
